The Enron Corpus is a large database of over 600,000 emails generated by 158 employees of the Enron Corporation and acquired by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation after the company's collapse.

Project Overview
In 2000, Enron was among the largest companies in the United States. However, by 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to pervasive corporate fraud. The ensuing Federal investigation unearthed a significant amount of usually confidential information, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives. In this project, we will apply the machine learning skills acquired from the Udacity course to develop a person of interest identifier based on the financial and email data disclosed as a result of the Enron scandal.
